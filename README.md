## üöÄ How It Works

CuteVision leverages the power of the Groq API and the LLaMA 4 Scout model to perform its analysis.

1.  **Image Input:** The user captures a photo with their device's camera or uploads an existing image file.
2.  **API Request:** The image is converted to a base64 string and sent to the Groq API's chat completions endpoint. A detailed prompt instructs the model to act as a high-precision nutrition analysis bot, analyze the image, and return a structured JSON object.
3.  **JSON Response:** The model returns a single, minified JSON object containing the food's title, a brief description, a detailed nutrition breakdown, a list of allergens, warnings, potential dangers, and a personalized healthy tip.
4.  **Display Results:** The application parses this JSON data and displays it in a clean, user-friendly interface with interactive charts and cards.

All data, including your API key and analysis history, is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`.

## üîß How to Use

1.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.
2.  **Set Your API Key:**
    *   Click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è).
    *   Navigate to the "API" tab.
    *   Enter your Groq API key. You can get one from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys).
    *   Click "Save Settings".
3.  **Analyze Food:**
    *   From the main screen, either click "Use Camera" to take a photo or "Upload Image" to select a file from your device.
    *   After capturing or selecting an image, you can optionally provide a name for the food to improve accuracy.
    *   Click "Analyze" and wait for the results.

## üîí Is It Safe?

Your Groq API key is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. It is **never shared with any external servers** besides the Groq API for analysis. However, please be aware that storing API keys in the browser is not a secure practice for production environments. This application is intended for development and personal use.

## üì± Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on mobile devices. It has been designed to work well on various screen sizes, including phones like the iPhone 7.
